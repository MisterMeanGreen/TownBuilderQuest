How Does this game work?

Buildings - Buildings are operated mostly by villagers. They each have a specific function which can only be activated through the use of unassigned villagers. The amount you give a building, the more it will output.

Villagers - Villagers are simply units that can be assigned to certain buildings to preform their function. If you have too many they become homeless. How many is too many? Well its by default 7. But can be raised through the use of farmers being assigned to farms. Homeless villagers cannot be assigned to any building. Every villager/homeless will be paid a daily fee of $15.

Selling - Quite straight forward, you can sell buildings, and the game will automatically unassign villagers and give back 90% of the money spent towards the building.

Events - When you end your turn, an event will happen. Most of the time its nothing, but sometimes you can gain something or even fight villagers. For the first week, no events will occur. Giving some lax time to build up.

Morale - Morale simply helps to dictate the general population feelings about you. If it is too low. NOT GOOD. If its too high and moderately high. Good.
